Run find_Cov.m 
then
run var_brady2.m

the other two files are function called by those two.

the kriging introduction is a great source. 

the other pdf is good when switching between covariance fuction (for kriging) and variogram function (when finding the parameters to fit the function empiracally to the dataset)
